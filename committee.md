**Abdallah El Ali** is a tenure-track researcher at the Distributed \& Interactive Systems group at Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. His research focuses on eliciting, capturing, and predicting momentary human emotion and behavior. He combines advances in HCI and machine learning to enable pervasive affect sensing in and beyond mobile interactions. Website: [https://abdoelali.com/](https://abdoelali.com/){:target="\_blank"}

**Monica Perusquía-Hernández** is a Research Associate at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Japan. Her research interests include affective computing, bio-signal processing, augmented human technology, and artificial intelligence. In particular, she is interested in sensing techniques such as Computer Vision, EMG and Skin Conductance to assess emotion and facial expression congruence when assessing user experience.

**Pete Denman** is a Senior Designer developing exploratory prototypes in "Labs" at Intel Corp. Focus on capturing emotion in daily life. He guides ideas through the design process, working with developers, engineers, and ethnographic researchers to create future technologies. Known best for being the lead designer at Intel for famed physicist Stephen Hawking's speech software, Denman could relate to Hawking's circumstances more than most due to his disability. Pete has a passion for connecting the areas of disabilities and learning/education with technology. Denman's current work focuses on affective computing and robots.

**Yomna Abdelrahman** is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Germany. Her research focuses on Thermal Imaging operating in the far-infrared spectrum, novel interactive systems, engagement sensing and adaptive bio-sensor assistive systems. Recently, her research focus shifted to affective computing using thermal cameras as unobtrusive sensor.

**Mariam Hassib** is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Germany. Her research interests are Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), and Physiological Computing. She is working on building systems which provide feedback and adapt to the cognitive and affective states of users. She leverages the current ubiquity of BCI devices and wearable physiological sensors to create new tools that support cognitive-awareness outside the lab environment.

**Alexander Meschtscherjakov** is Associate Professor at the Center for Human-Computer Interaction of Salzburg University. He is focusing on persuasive interaction technologies, automotive user interfaces, contextual user experience and challenges of automation for HCI with a special focus on affective computing. He has co-organised conferences such as Persuasive â15 and more than 25 workshops (e.g., CHI 2019).

**Denzil Ferreira** is an Associate Professor in Mobile Computing. His research interests are on technology-driven human behavior sensing and modeling, juxtaposing methods from large-scale data analysis, sensor instrumentation, applied machine learning, mobile and ubiquitous computing to understand and study a variety of human behavioral and social phenomena in naturalistic settings.

**Niels Henze** is professor for Media Informatics at the University of Regensburg. His research interests are mobile human-computer interaction and pervasive computing. Particularly, he is interested in large-scale studies using mobile application stores as a research tool, interlinking physical objects and digital information, and multimodal interfaces. His recent work focuses on identifying, manipulating and evaluating how our sense of presence is affected in virtual reality environments.
