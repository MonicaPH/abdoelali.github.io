title: Momentary Emotion Elicitation & Capture (MEEC)
---


A one-day workshop will take place on April 25th or 26th, 2020 at the [ACM CHI 2020 Conference](https://chi2020.acm.org/){:target="\_blank"} in Honolulu (Hawaii, USA).

## About

Recognizing human emotions and responding appropriately has the potential to radically change the way we interact with technology. However, to train machines to sensibly detect and recognize human emotions, we need valid emotion ground truths. A fundamental challenge here is the momentary emotion elicitation and capture (MEEC) from individuals continuously and in real-time, without adversely affecting user experience.

In this first edition of the one-day CHI 2020 workshop, we will (a) explore and define novel elicitation tasks (b) survey sensing and annotation techniques (c) create a taxonomy of when and where to apply an elicitation method.


## How to Participate

We invite position papers, posters, and demos (2-8 pages, incl. references) that present emotion elicitation and/or capture methods. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by 2 peers, and selected on their potential to spark discussion. Submissions should be in the [SIGCHI Extended Abstracts](https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/){:target="\_blank"} format and submitted in PDF through [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=meec2020){:target="\_blank"}. Accepted submissions will be made available on the workshop website. At least one author must register for the workshop and one day of the conference.
